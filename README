Artillery Duel Network - The very first networked game for the Commodore 64 with Ethernet cartridge.

Supports any CS8900-based cart with the RR-Net mappings (RR-Net, FB-Net, 64NIC+, etc.)  Should also work on the ETH64 but we never tried it.

Initially, this was going to be a clone of "Weather War", and you'll see that reflected in the documentation especially.  Still, we stuck with a lot of the same overall game logic and protocol.  

HUGE THANKS to Oliver "Six" VieBrooks for writing netlib64, and allowing me to include (slightly hacked) parts of it here in its unfinished, yet functional, state.  I also made liberal use of his many clever DASM macros.

==================================================

As presented here, this is targeted for building on Windows.  DASM (dasm.exe) from http://dasm-dillon.sourceforge.net/ is provided to get you started quickly.  Just type 'make' [1].  Should be pretty easy to build under Linux or any other platform that DASM runs on though. 

The output file is prefixed by a ! to flag it as the main loader file on an IDE64.  This is optional.

==================================================

Thanks:

NETWORK CODE: Again, Oliver "Six" VieBrooks, without whom this game wouldn't have been possible at all.

CODE TIPS: Robin Harbron

MUSIC: "Eve of War" by Raik Picheta  

PLAYTESTERS: Robin Harbron and Thurstan Johnston

Plus I borrowed bits of code from others, see the source, I tried to document every instance.

Issues:  See TODO.txt

[1] Not a real makefile by any stretch of the imagination!
